I'm on a mission to unlock human potential in the people I work with & through the experiences we create.

I lead the product team at [VMware Pivotal Labs](https://tanzu.vmware.com/labs){:target="_blank"} in London and I volunteer as a Board Member of [Product Management Festival](https://productmanagementfestival.com/zurich/){:target="_blank"}. I'm a coach, mentor and runner with a keen interest to learn new things.

I’ve co-founded a few (failed) startups – [FitUsIn](https://www.smh.com.au/business/small-business/casual-gym-visit-app-an-australian-first-20130804-2r7h1.html){:target="_blank"}, [DataMunch](https://gust.com/companies/datamunch){:target="_blank"} and RippleCrowd. I’ve had the privilege of working with great companies and startups such as [PwC](https://www.pwc.com.au/){:target="_blank"}, [Podio](https://podio.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Freelancer.com](https://www.freelancer.com/){:target="_blank"}. I was also the founding licensee for [TEDxMacquarieUniversity](https://www.tedxmacquarieuni.com/){:target="_blank"}.
