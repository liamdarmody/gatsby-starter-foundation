Hi, I’m Liam. I’m passionate about technology and how it can be used to make people’s lives better.

I enjoy working at the intersection of business and technology to build products that people love to use. I like to wear many hats, but I have a particular love for product design, development and marketing.

## What I Love

I love good clean design that is functional and customer centric.

I love discovering new music. Spotify is a fantastic tool for that.

I love big adventures. Hiking, traveling, backpacking, camping, etc.

I love hanging out with people who are passionate about something.

I love flavoursome food, especially the diverse selection that is available in London and Sydney.

## What I Do

I lead the Product Management team at VMware Pivotal Labs in London. We are agile to the core and lean in practice. Using techniques like pair programming, test-driven development, user-centered design and lean startup experimentation, we teach companies how to build world-class software.

## What I've Done

I’ve co-founded a few (failed) startups – FitUsIn, DataMunch and RippleCrowd. I’ve had the privilege of working with great companies and startups such as PwC, Podio and Freelancer.com. I was also the founding licensee for TEDxMacquarieUniversity.
