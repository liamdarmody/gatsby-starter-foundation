The first version of my website was built using Wordpress. I had a lot of fun learning how to build websites and tried out a bunch of themes. I then took my website to Squarespace for the ease of content management. For non-developers, it has a better user experience than Wordpress. More recently, I made the decision to rebuild my website to learn something new. I had heard about the Jamstack and wanted a project to learn the basics.

Here are some of the things I wanted out of my new site:

* Simple
* Easy to add new posts
* Fast
* Cheap

After doing my research and trying a few starters, I ended up using a Jamstack theme called Foundation with GatsbyJS and Netlify CMS (https://stackrole.com/jamstack/foundation).

Here are some resources that I found particularly useful:
